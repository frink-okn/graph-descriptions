# Class: QUDT Datatype (qudt_Datatype)


_A data type is a definition of a set of values (for example, "all integers between 0 and 10"), and the allowable operations on those values; the meaning of the data; and the way values of that type can be stored. Some types are primitive - built-in to the language, with no visible internal structure - e.g. Boolean; others are composite - constructed from one or more other types (of either kind) - e.g. lists, arrays, structures, unions. Object-oriented programming extends this with classes which encapsulate both the structure of a type and the operations that can be performed on it. Some languages provide strong typing, others allow implicit type conversion and/or explicit type conversion._
