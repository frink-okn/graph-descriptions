# Type: Seegrid-basicDecimal




_The usually finite representation of a decimal number. It differs from the common binary Real implementation in that it can represent 1/10 (one-tenth) without error, while binary real representation can only represent powers of 1/2 (one-half) exactly. Since many currencies are decimal, these representations are preferred in dealing with such moneys. This is also true for mile markers, which are often given in decimals.␊␊Can be thought of as an integer part followed by a fractional part given in multiples of powers of 1/10 (tenths)._
