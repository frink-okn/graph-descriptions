    Concerns about harmful algal blooms HAB have increased over the lastdecade largely
    because of the perceived increase in the number andduration of events The toxins
    produced by these species cause finfishand shellfish poisoning and mortality of
    marine animals includingmammals and birdsAdvance warning of HABs increases the
    options for managing theseevents The HAB Project develops and supports systems
    that provideinformation on the location and extent of red tide blooms in the Gulfof
    Mexico The Experimental HAB bulletin alerts subscribers todeveloping blooms and
    changes in the location and extent of existingblooms The HAB Mapping System HABMapS
    provides the position of anidentified bloom and data from environmental conditions
    that mayaffect the extent or position Both tools rely on remote sensingtechnology

    The US National Park Service NPS proposes a series of integrated research monitoring
    education and outreach projects designed to better understand and communicate
    change in Arctic environments in Alaska United States and adjacent areas of Chukotka
    Russia and the Yukon Territory Canada Proposed projects within this effort include
    the followingImplement the Vital Sign Monitoring Program for Arctic ARCN and Central
    Alaska CAKN Networks These new programs based on conceptual models and long term
    monitoring objectives now in development will implement monitoring of a broad
    suite of biological chemical and physical indicators on 406 million acres of NPS
    lands and waters in and around eight national park units in Alaska Implement baseline
    archaeological inventories and ethnographic research During 20072008 new archaeological
    inventories will be conducted at selected locations in Cape Krusenstern Denali
    and YukonCharley Rivers to locate and systematically document prehistoric human
    occupation sites in arctic and subarctic coastal inland and riverine environments
    Also ethnographic research at YukonCharley will synthesize oral written and archival
    data to produce a comprehensive ethnographic assessmentReport results of the Western
    Airborne Contaminants Assessment Program WACAP During 20072008 this ongoing multiregional
    interagency US program will report on airborne contaminants in arctic subarctic
    highaltitude and high latitude areas A series of journal articles and presentations
    will be submitted for publication during the IPY Results will include contaminants
    assessments spring snow pack data and atmospheric back trajectories for multiple
    airborne contaminants potentially affecting polar areas A separate study will
    report on biological effects of airborne heavy metal deposition mineral dust in
    Cape KrusensternConvene two conferences on arctic parks and protected areas Scientific
    conferences and workshops focused on science and conservation of Arctic ecosystems
    and cultures will be cosponsored by NPS during the IPY The 2007 bilingual conference
    in Chukotka will be organized with Russian cooperators through the Beringian International
    Heritage Program Beringia The 2008 symposium in Alaska will be organized with
    the USGS other US cooperating agencies and possibly Beringia program cooperators
    Both symposia will be multidisciplinary biological physical cultural and social
    sciencesFocused journal issue on climate change in Alaskas national parks A focused
    issue of the Alaska Park Science journal will be published during 2007 in both
    printed and webbased formats Internetbased supporting materials targeted to meet
    the curriculum requirements of middle and highschool science teachers and students
    will also be developed Issues in 20082009 will highlight findings from research
    underway during IPYDigitized photo archives of arctic national parks NPS collections
    of Alaska photos will be screened and a representative collection of historic
    photographs documenting natural and cultural resources and human activities in
    Alaskas NPS areas targeting 50100 photographs of each area will be digitally reproduced
    for use in IPY symposia and publications This collection will also be augmented
    by recent photos possibly including repeat visits to photograph and document change
    at the sites of historic photographs Augment photo collection by working in cooperation
    with local Native residents and Native entities of the 36 neighboring communities
    to Arctic parks to acquire copies of historical photos documenting historical
    landform conditions Obtain use permission digitize and make available to Arctic

    Support for a series of new focused projects will be provided through identification
    and consideration of IPYrelated criteria in the proposal request and evaluation
    processes of appropriate National Park Service competitive grant programs Eligible
    activities will include research natural and cultural resource inventories and
    monitoring recording of local and traditional knowledge trend analysis education
    and public outreach in Alaska and adjacent areas of Chukotka and the Yukon Territory
    For IPY 20072008 we will specifically invite proposals to study and inform the
    public about arcticsubarctic climate change global and local contaminants exotic
    species in the arctic and subarctic increasing human use of parks and protected
    areas and resource development within and surrounding these areasSummary provided

    The Ordovician Period lasted almost 45 million years beginning 4883 million years
    ago and ending 4437 million years ago During this period the area north of the
    tropics was almost entirely ocean and most of the worlds land was collected into
    the southern supercontinent Gondwana Throughout the Ordovician Gondwana shifted
    towards the South Pole and much of it was submerged underwater The Ordovician
    is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates including graptolites trilobites
    brachiopods and the conodonts early vertebrates A typical marine community consisted
    of these animals plus red and green algae primitive fish cephalopods corals crinoids
    and gastropods More recently tetrahedral spores that are similar to those of primitive
    land plants have been found suggesting that plants invaded the land at this time
    From the Lower to Middle Ordovician the Earth experienced a milder climate  the
    weather was warm and the atmosphere contained a lot of moisture However when Gondwana
    finally settled on the South Pole during the Upper Ordovician massive glaciers
    formed causing shallow seas to drain and sea levels to drop This likely caused
    the mass extinctions that characterize the end of the Ordovician in which 60 of
    all marine invertebrate genera and 25 of all families went extinct

    A generalpurpose programming language that is interpreted and contains several
    features such as dynamic typing along with the flexible data types is known as
    ICI not an acronym programming language It is considered to be similar to the
    Perl language This ICI language comprises flow control constructs and also contains
    some operators of the C language It is not an objectoriented language but some
    of the features of OOP can be attained by a specific inheritance method known
    as superstructures Similar to C this ICI programming language has the same system
    interface and a standard library for builtin functions
