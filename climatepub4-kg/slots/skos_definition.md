      research monitoring education and outreach projects designed to better understand
      and communicate change in Arctic environments in Alaska United States and adjacent
      areas of Chukotka Russia and the Yukon Territory Canada Proposed projects within
      this effort include the followingImplement the Vital Sign Monitoring Program
      for Arctic ARCN and Central Alaska CAKN Networks These new programs based on
      conceptual models and long term monitoring objectives now in development will
      implement monitoring of a broad suite of biological chemical and physical indicators
      on 406 million acres of NPS lands and waters in and around eight national park
      units in Alaska Implement baseline archaeological inventories and ethnographic
      research During 20072008 new archaeological inventories will be conducted at
      selected locations in Cape Krusenstern Denali and YukonCharley Rivers to locate
      and systematically document prehistoric human occupation sites in arctic and
      subarctic coastal inland and riverine environments Also ethnographic research
      at YukonCharley will synthesize oral written and archival data to produce a
      comprehensive ethnographic assessmentReport results of the Western Airborne
      Contaminants Assessment Program WACAP During 20072008 this ongoing multiregional
      interagency US program will report on airborne contaminants in arctic subarctic
      highaltitude and high latitude areas A series of journal articles and presentations
      will be submitted for publication during the IPY Results will include contaminants
      assessments spring snow pack data and atmospheric back trajectories for multiple
      airborne contaminants potentially affecting polar areas A separate study will
      report on biological effects of airborne heavy metal deposition mineral dust
      in Cape KrusensternConvene two conferences on arctic parks and protected areas
      Scientific conferences and workshops focused on science and conservation of
      Arctic ecosystems and cultures will be cosponsored by NPS during the IPY The
      2007 bilingual conference in Chukotka will be organized with Russian cooperators
      through the Beringian International Heritage Program Beringia The 2008 symposium
      in Alaska will be organized with the USGS other US cooperating agencies and
      possibly Beringia program cooperators Both symposia will be multidisciplinary
      biological physical cultural and social sciencesFocused journal issue on climate
      change in Alaskas national parks A focused issue of the Alaska Park Science
      journal will be published during 2007 in both printed and webbased formats Internetbased
      supporting materials targeted to meet the curriculum requirements of middle
      and highschool science teachers and students will also be developed Issues in
      20082009 will highlight findings from research underway during IPYDigitized
      photo archives of arctic national parks NPS collections of Alaska photos will
      be screened and a representative collection of historic photographs documenting
      natural and cultural resources and human activities in Alaskas NPS areas targeting
      50100 photographs of each area will be digitally reproduced for use in IPY symposia
      and publications This collection will also be augmented by recent photos possibly
      including repeat visits to photograph and document change at the sites of historic
      photographs Augment photo collection by working in cooperation with local Native
      residents and Native entities of the 36 neighboring communities to Arctic parks
      to acquire copies of historical photos documenting historical landform conditions
      Obtain use permission digitize and make available to Arctic researchers for
      use as dated baseline conditionsFocused competitive funding programs Support
      for a series of new focused projects will be provided through identification
      and consideration of IPYrelated criteria in the proposal request and evaluation
      processes of appropriate National Park Service competitive grant programs Eligible
      activities will include research natural and cultural resource inventories and
      monitoring recording of local and traditional knowledge trend analysis education
      and public outreach in Alaska and adjacent areas of Chukotka and the Yukon Territory
      For IPY 20072008 we will specifically invite proposals to study and inform the
      public about arcticsubarctic climate change global and local contaminants exotic
      species in the arctic and subarctic increasing human use of parks and protected
      areas and resource development within and surrounding these areasSummary provided

    example_object: The Ordovician Period lasted almost 45 million years beginning
      4883 million years ago and ending 4437 million years ago During this period
      the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean and most of the worlds
      land was collected into the southern supercontinent Gondwana Throughout the
      Ordovician Gondwana shifted towards the South Pole and much of it was submerged
      underwater The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates
      including graptolites trilobites brachiopods and the conodonts early vertebrates
      A typical marine community consisted of these animals plus red and green algae
      primitive fish cephalopods corals crinoids and gastropods More recently tetrahedral
      spores that are similar to those of primitive land plants have been found suggesting
      that plants invaded the land at this time From the Lower to Middle Ordovician
      the Earth experienced a milder climate  the weather was warm and the atmosphere
      contained a lot of moisture However when Gondwana finally settled on the South
      Pole during the Upper Ordovician massive glaciers formed causing shallow seas
      to drain and sea levels to drop This likely caused the mass extinctions that
      characterize the end of the Ordovician in which 60 of all marine invertebrate
      genera and 25 of all families went extinct
