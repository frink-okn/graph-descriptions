      4883 million years ago and ending 4437 million years ago During this period
      the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean and most of the worlds
      land was collected into the southern supercontinent Gondwana Throughout the
      Ordovician Gondwana shifted towards the South Pole and much of it was submerged
      underwater The Ordovician is best known for its diverse marine invertebrates
      including graptolites trilobites brachiopods and the conodonts early vertebrates
      A typical marine community consisted of these animals plus red and green algae
      primitive fish cephalopods corals crinoids and gastropods More recently tetrahedral
      spores that are similar to those of primitive land plants have been found suggesting
      that plants invaded the land at this time From the Lower to Middle Ordovician
      the Earth experienced a milder climate  the weather was warm and the atmosphere
      contained a lot of moisture However when Gondwana finally settled on the South
      Pole during the Upper Ordovician massive glaciers formed causing shallow seas
      to drain and sea levels to drop This likely caused the mass extinctions that
      characterize the end of the Ordovician in which 60 of all marine invertebrate
      genera and 25 of all families went extinct

    example_object: A generalpurpose programming language that is interpreted and
      contains several features such as dynamic typing along with the flexible data
      types is known as ICI not an acronym programming language It is considered to
      be similar to the Perl language This ICI language comprises flow control constructs
      and also contains some operators of the C language It is not an objectoriented
      language but some of the features of OOP can be attained by a specific inheritance
      method known as superstructures Similar to C this ICI programming language has
      the same system interface and a standard library for builtin functions
